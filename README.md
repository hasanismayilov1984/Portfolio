### 📌 Multi-label Text Classification (Scikit-learn)

This project classifies scientific paper abstracts and titles into multiple relevant research categories, such as Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics.

🧠 **Key Features:**
- Combined text features from `TITLE` and `ABSTRACT`
- Applied **TF-IDF** vectorization with max 10,000 features
- Trained a **OneVsRest Logistic Regression** model for multi-label prediction
- Used **custom probability thresholds** to fine-tune label sensitivity
- Output predictions on a separate test dataset

🔧 **Tools & Libraries:**  
`Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

📁 **Project Files:**  
`Test.py`, `test_predictions.csv`
